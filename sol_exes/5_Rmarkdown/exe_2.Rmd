## Intro and Methods


- Analysis of the birth weight of 189 newborns at Baystate Medical Center, Springfield, Mass (1986).

- Data are summarized as mean (SD) and n (%) as appropriate. 

- Group comparisons: 
    + t-test for (quantitative vars)
    + chi-square test with Yate's correction (categorical vars). 

- All tests were two-sided

- A result was declared statistically significant if p < 0.05. 

- The analysis was done with the R language (version 4.2.1).

## Birth weights

Birth weights ranged from 709 to 4990 grams.

Mean (SD) = 2944.6 (729.2) grams. 

```{r}
plot1 <- gf_dens(~ bwt, data = d, color = "blue", size = 1, xlab = "Birth weight (grams)") %>% 
  gf_histogram(binwidth=500, color = "black", fill = "white") %>% 
  gf_theme(theme_minimal())

plot1
```


## Birth weights according to smoking

\

```{r }
plot2 <- gf_boxplot(bwt ~ smoke, data = d, ylab = "Birth weight (grams)", xlab = "") %>% 
  gf_refine(coord_flip()) %>% 
  gf_theme(theme_minimal())

plot2

```

library(patchwork)
plot1 + plot2
```
