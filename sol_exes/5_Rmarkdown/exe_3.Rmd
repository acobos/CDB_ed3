## Introduction

We analysed the birth weight of `r nrow(d)` newborns recorded in the Baystate Medical Center, Springfield, Mass during 1986, and its associations with demographic characteristics of mothers.

## Methods

Data are summarized as mean (SD) and n (%) as appropriate. For comparisons between groups the t-test and chi-square test with Yateâ€™s continuity correction were used, for quantitative and categorical variables respectively. All tests were two-sided, and a result was declared statistically significant if p \< 0.05. The analysis was done with the R language (version 4.2.1).

## Results

Birth weights ranged from `r min(d$bwt)` to `r max(d$bwt)` grams, with mean (SD) of `r round(mean(d$bwt))` (`r round(sd(d$bwt))`) grams. The histogram of birth weights with overlapped density, shows a bell-shaped and quite symmetrical distribution (see figure \ref{fig:birth_hist_dens}).

```{r birth_hist_dens, fig.cap="Histogram and density of birth weights"}

gf_dens(~ bwt, data = d, 
        color = "blue", size = 1,
        xlab = "Birth weight (grams)") %>% 
  gf_histogram(binwidth=500, color = "black", fill = "white") %>% 
  gf_theme(theme_minimal())

```

\newpage

A descriptive analysis by smoking status is shown in table \ref{tab:descriptive}.

```{r descriptive}
Hmisc::label(d$bwt) <- "Birth weight (grams)"
Hmisc::label(d$bw) <- "Birth weight, categorized"
Hmisc::label(d$race) <- "Race"
Hmisc::label(d$ht) <- "Arterial hypertension"
Hmisc::label(d$ui) <- "Uterine irritability"

library(compareGroups)
descrTable(smoke ~ bwt + bw + race + ht + ui, data = d,
           show.p.overall = FALSE,
           hide.no = c("no-AHT", "no-UI")) %>%   
  export2md(caption = "Descriptive analysis by smoking status") 
```

Figure \ref{fig:birth_smoke_boxp} shows the boxplots of birth weights in smoking and non-smoking mothers. A shift to lower values is apparent in smoking mothers.

```{r birth_smoke_boxp, fig.cap="Birth weight according to smoking satus of mothers during pregnancy"}

gf_boxplot(bwt ~ smoke, data = d, ylab = "Birth weight (grams)", xlab = "") %>% 
  gf_summary(fun = mean, col = "red") %>% 
  gf_refine(coord_flip()) %>% 
  gf_theme(theme_minimal())

```

```{r}
result <- t.test(bwt ~ smoke, data = d)
mean_ci <- paste0(round(result$estimate[1] - result$estimate[2]),
                  " [95% CI: ",
                  round(result$conf.int)[1],
                  ", ",
                  round(result$conf.int)[2],
                  "]")
```

Birth weights tended to be lower in smoking mothers than in non-smoking mothers (t-test p = `r round(result$p.value, 3)`), with a mean difference of `r mean_ci` grams.
