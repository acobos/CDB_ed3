## Introduction

We analysed the birth weight of 189 newborns recorded in the Baystate Medical Center, Springfield, Mass during 1986, and its associations with demographic characteristics of mothers.

## Methods

Data are summarized as mean (SD) and n (%) as appropriate. For comparisons between groups the t-test and chi-square test with Yateâ€™s continuity correction were used, for quantitative and categorical variables respectively. All tests were two-sided, and a result was declared statistically significant if p < 0.05. The analysis was done with the R language (version 4.2.1).

## Results

Birth weights ranged from 709 to 4990 grams, with mean (SD) of 2944.6 (729.2) grams. The histogram of birth weights with overlapped density, shows a bell-shaped and quite symmetrical distribution.

```{r birth_hist_dens, fig.cap="Histogram and density of birth weights"}

gf_dens(~ bwt, data = d, color = "blue", size = 1, xlab = "Birth weight (grams)") %>% 
  gf_histogram(binwidth=500, color = "black", fill = "white") %>% 
  gf_theme(theme_minimal())

```


The following figure shows the boxplots of birth weights in smoking and non-smoking mothers. A shift to lower values is apparent in smoking mothers. 

```{r birth_smoke_boxp, fig.cap="Birth weight according to smoking satus of mothers during pregnancy"}

gf_boxplot(bwt ~ smoke, data = d, ylab = "Birth weight (grams)", xlab = "") %>%
  gf_refine(coord_flip()) %>% 
  gf_theme(theme_minimal())

```
